# Module: MMM-Wallpaper
The module allows you to add wallpapers from various online sources.  Useful for MagicMirror installations that aren't actually mirrors.

## Installation

In your terminal, go to your MagicMirror's Module folder:
````
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
````

Clone this repository:
````
git clone https://github.com/kolbyjack/MMM-Wallpaper.git
````

Configure the module in your `config.js` file.

**Note:** After starting the Mirror, it will take a few seconds before the wallpapers start to appear.

## Using the module

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
````javascript
modules: [
  {
    module: "MMM-Wallpaper",
    position: "fullscreen_below",
    config: { // See "Configuration options" for more information.
      source: "bing",
      slideInterval: 60 * 1000 // Change slides every minute
