# Module: MMM-Wallpaper
The module allows you to add wallpapers from various online sources.  Useful for MagicMirror installations that aren't actually mirrors.

## Installation

In your terminal, go to your MagicMirror's Module folder:
````
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
````

Clone this repository:
````
git clone https://github.com/kolbyjack/MMM-Wallpaper.git
````

Install the module dependencies:
````
cd MMM-Wallpaper
npm install
````

Configure the module in your `config.js` file.

**Note:** After starting the Mirror, it will take a few seconds before the wallpapers start to appear.

## Using the module

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
````javascript
modules: [
  {
    module: "MMM-Wallpaper",
    position: "fullscreen_below",
    config: { // See "Configuration options" for more information.
      source: "bing",
      slideInterval: 60 * 1000 // Change slides every minute
    }
  }
]
````

Source-specific configuration items:

apod / apodhd:

|Option|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`"nasaApiKey"`|`none`|Sign up for an [api key](https://api.nasa.gov/) and enter it here. (Required)|

flickr-api:

|Option|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`"flickrApiKey"`|`none`|Sign up for an [api key](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/noncommercial/) and enter it here. (Required)|
|`"flickrDataCacheTime"`| `24*60*60*3600` (1 day) | How long to cache image metadata retrieved from Flickr. |
|`"flickrResultsPerPage"`| `500` | How many photo results per page to request from the Flickr API. |

*Notes:*
* You can specify multiple Flickr sources separated by `;`. For example: `flickr-api:publicPhotos;photos/<user1>/favorites;photos/<user2>/favorites`
  * If `shuffle` is `true`, up to `maximumEntries` will be listed from each source, then shuffled and no more than `maximumEntries` presented.
  * If `shuffle` is `false`, up to `maximumEntries` photos will be presented from the sources in order.
* Flickr limits usage by a single API key to 3600 queries per hour. If you set a very high `maximumEntries` you may run into this limit. This module makes the following Flickr API calls every `updateInterval`:
  * At least 1 call to `getPublicPhotos` per configured source (each call returns up to 500 photos; if there are more, and you've set `maximumEntries` higher, there will be further calls)
  * 1 call to `getSizes` per photo selected for display (at most `maximumEntries`); the results are cached for `flickrDataCacheTime`.
* Very large images can consume excessive memory on the client. To prevent this, tune `maxWidth` and `maxHeight` to suit your display setup.
  * It is important to not set the limits too low! Photos with unusual aspect ratios can lead to a poor experience. We suggest about 1.5x your display resolution as a good starting point.

## Notifications

MMM-Wallpaper can react to the following notifications sent by other modules:

|Notification|Payload|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`LOAD_NEXT_WALLPAPER`|`none`|Will load the next wallpaper from the configured source.|
|`UPDATE_WALLPAPER_CONFIG`|`string` or `object`|If the payload is a string, the module will use it as the new source to begin loading wallpapers.  If the payload is an object, the module will update its configuration with the object's properties.  In either case, a new wallpaper will immediately be loaded and the update timer will be reset.|
|`USER_PRESENCE`|`bool`|Will take the appropriate action to hide or show itself based on the value of the payload and the configured `userPresnseAction`.|
